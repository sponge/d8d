summary: A toy 2D engine written in C++, with mod support through a DLL containing all gamecode. Supports a drawing command set similar to fantasy consoles, but without intentional restrictions. Scripting language support provided through Wren.

description:

My unnamed 2D game engine (sometimes known as `sdlgame` since that's the GitHub repo name) has been a long-term on and off personal project since July 2016. It's primarily just been a fun thing to work on, without any real end goal for shipping a game. It also has served to be one of the biggest sources of learning C++ and understanding the consequences of certain lower level designs. It has, however, successfully been used to bring a game from start to completion! [Clive Sturridge's Battlement Defense Legacy Collection](/personal/clive) uses this engine, and the experience of using it was surprisingly pretty good!

The engine doesn't really prescribe any big opinions on structure or API (there's not even any sort of ECS included) but the biggest inspirations were probably [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) and [TIC-80](https://tic.computer/). Fantasy console APIs are a great sweet spot of what most people need for making 2D games, and I just wanted something that has a similar API, but without the other restrictions that normally come with fantasy consoles.

While the engine originally started off supporting DLLs for loading game code, the default DLL has now evolved to support the [Wren scripting language](http://wren.io/). Wren has been an absolute delight to use, it feels like a modern Lua without the weirdness, or a little like a tiny modern JavaScript. I ended up implementing Wren in this engine in order to try it out, and have been a big fan of it since.

It is made up of several pre-existing libraries:

- [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org) - windowing, OpenGL context, input, DLL support
- [Wren](https://www.wren.io) - embedded scripting language  
- [NanoVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg/) - 2d graphics  
- [PhysicsFS](https://icculus.org/physfs/) - virtual filesystem, zip loading
- [dear imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) - debugging tools  
- [SoLoud](http://sol.gfxile.net/soloud/) - audio engine  
- [TMX C Loader](https://github.com/baylej/tmx) - loading [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) maps
- [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) - GL extension support

`sdlgame` currently runs on Windows, web via Emscripten, and OS X. It probably also runs on Linux, but I haven't bothered to try.
