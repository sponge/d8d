summary: Another weird little Earthbound related thing. This one features state-of-the-art dog AI in order to simulate the activities of a dog, and prevents dogs from doing the same activity. Put a number in the has and reload to increase the amount of dogs. Uses [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) for rendering.
